## Conversion Notes

### 1. Package Structure
- Python module becomes a Go package named `swgoh_comlink`
- All imports are consolidated at the top following Go conventions
- The `__all__` export list in Python is replaced by capitalized function names in Go (public vs private)

### 2. Exception Handling
- Python exceptions are translated to Go error handling patterns
- Custom exception types (`SwgohComlinkException`, `SwgohComlinkValueError`) are defined as Go error types (referenced but implementation should be in a separate `exceptions.go` file)
- All functions that can fail now return `(result, error)` tuples following Go idioms

### 3. Type System Differences
- Python's dynamic typing is replaced with Go's static typing using `interface{}` where flexibility is needed
- Optional parameters in Python are replaced with explicit parameters in Go (default values must be passed by caller)
- Python's `None` is replaced with Go's `nil`
- Python dictionaries (`dict`) are translated to `map[string]interface{}`
- Python lists are translated to Go slices `[]interface{}`

### 4. HTTP Client
- Python's `requests` library is replaced with Go's standard `net/http` package
- SSL verification is disabled using `TLSClientConfig` with `InsecureSkipVerify: true` (equivalent to `verify=False`)
- HTTP client is stored as a struct field for reuse

### 5. HMAC Authentication
- Python's `hmac` and `hashlib` are replaced with Go's `crypto/hmac`, `crypto/sha256`, and `crypto/md5`
- Byte encoding/decoding is handled explicitly in Go
- Hex encoding uses `encoding/hex` package

### 6. Decorator Pattern
- Python's `@param_alias` decorator cannot be directly translated to Go
- The decorator functionality is integrated directly into the `GetPlayerArena` method
- The parameter aliasing is documented but the implementation is simpler in Go

### 7. Regular Expressions
- Python's `re` module is replaced with Go's `regexp` package
- Regular expressions are compiled once at package level for efficiency

### 8. JSON Handling
- Python's `json.dumps()` and `json.loads()` are replaced with Go's `json.Marshal()` and `json.Unmarshal()`
- Compact JSON formatting (no spaces) is the default in Go's `json.Marshal()`

### 9. String Formatting
- Python's f-strings are replaced with `fmt.Sprintf()` in Go
- String concatenation uses `+` operator or `strings.Join()`

### 10. Environment Variables
- Python's `os.environ.get()` is replaced with Go's `os.Getenv()`

### 11. Time Handling
- Python's `time.time()` is replaced with Go's `time.Now().UnixNano()` divided by milliseconds

### 12. Method Naming
- Public methods (exported) start with capital letters in Go
- Private methods (unexported) start with lowercase letters
- Aliases are provided for both PEP-compliant (snake_case) and non-PEP (camelCase) naming

### 13. Class Structure
- Python class is translated to Go struct with methods
- Constructor `__init__` becomes `NewSwgohComlink` factory function
- Class attributes become struct fields

### 14. Logger
- Python's logger is abstracted to an interface in Go to allow flexible logging implementations
- The actual logger implementation should be provided by the caller

### 15. Constants and Helpers
- References to `Constants.get()` and `get_logger()` indicate external dependencies
- These should be implemented in separate files (`constants.go`, `globals.go`, `helpers.go`)
- Placeholder implementation for `GetConstant()` is included

### 16. Missing Implementations Required
The following files need to be created to complete the translation:
- `exceptions.go`: Define `SwgohComlinkException` and `SwgohComlinkValueError` types
- `constants.go`: Implement `Constants` functionality and `GetConstant()` function
- `globals.go`: Implement logger functionality
- `helpers.go`: Implement any additional helper functions
- `version.go`: Define the `Version` variable

### 17. API Compatibility
- All public methods maintain the same functionality as the Python version
- Parameter order and types are preserved where possible
- Return types are adjusted to Go conventions (adding error returns)

### 18. Additional Notes
- The incomplete `GetNameSpaces` method at the end is fully implemented
- All URL sanitization logic is preserved
- All HMAC security logic is faithfully reproduced
- The payload ordering requirement for MD5 hash calculation is maintained through consistent JSON marshaling
